# microfrontends-demo


try to change directory to each directory in the root(one, two, shell) and install node modules and then use npm start to view the microfrontends in action

for example: <br/>
   > **cd one<br/>**
   > **npm install<br/>**
   > **npm start<br/>**

Do the same steps for directory two and directory shell as well.
